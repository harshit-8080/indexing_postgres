Questiobn :- What is a Bloom filter?

1.  It is a probabilistic data structure designed to answer the set membership question- Is this element present in the Set?

2.  It is highly space efficient and does not store the actual items.

3.  It can tell very quickly if an item does not exist in a set or if it may be existing in the Set.

4.  However, it cannot tell if an item is definitely present in a Set.
