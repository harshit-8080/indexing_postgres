1.  You can create an index on more than one column of a table. 

2.  This index is called a multicolumn index, a composite index, a combined index, or a concatenated index.

Examples :-

    1.  CREATE INDEX test_table_a_b_c_idx  ON test_table(a,b,c);
    
        here we have created composite index on a, b and c.
    
    2.  When defining a multicolumn index

    3.  you should place the columns which are often used in the WHERE clause at the beginning of the column list.
    
    4.  And the columns that are less frequently used in the condition after.  
        


    5.  In the above Examples, the PostgreSQL optimizer will consider using the index in the following cases:
            1.  WHERE a = v1 and b = v2 and c = v3;
            2.  WHERE a = v1 and b = v2;
            3.  WHERE a = v1;

    6.  However, it will not consider using the index in the following cases:
            1.  WHERE  c = v3;
            2.  WHERE b = v2 and c = v3;    

            If we do above, it will do seq. scan not index scan because it's not on leftmost side.

    
    7. These composite indexing we should use when we need to use "and" and "or clauses more often.
