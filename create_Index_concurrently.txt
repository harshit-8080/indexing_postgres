Point to remember
    
    1.  While creating index on any field on production or on server or on local database.

    2.  Insert operations on that field can't be done as this field is block or being to create index.  

    3.  Select operations can be done easily.


Postgres do things in very better way by giving us a way to create index concurrently

    Examples :-
    
        Create index concurrently g_idx on students(grade);

        Whiile doing things concurrently, We can Select and Insert rows along with creating index.
