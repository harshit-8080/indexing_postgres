Types of Index in Database

    1.  Primary Index (Cluster Index) :-    (only one cluster in a table)
        1.  If the data file or row is in sequential sorted order in table based on some column or attribute.
        2.  Primary Index or Cluster Index is an index whose search key also defines the sequential order of the file.
        3.  Primary key column is automatically considered as cluster index column because they stored in sorted order.

    

    2. Non cluster Index :-
        1.  When we create non cluster index column on table it creates seprate index table with the sorted value of indexes and a pointer.
        2. This pointer actucal points to a physical row.



    3. Dense Index :- Example of Non Cluster Index
        1. The dense index contains an index record for very search key value in the data file.
        2. It contains the search key value and a pointer which points to table.
        3. No cluster is example of dense indexing.
        4. In Dense Index table, -> no. of entries in the the index file = no.of rows in datafile.


    4. Sparse Key :- Example of Cluster Index
        1. An index record appears for only some of the search-key values.
        2. It helps you to resolve the issues of dence indexing in DBMS.
        3. In Sparse Index table, -> no. of entries in the the index file = no.of blocks in datafile.
        4. In this technique, A range of index columns stores the same data block address.
        5. When data needs to be retrived, The block address will be fetched.
