We can create indexes of key and non key columns in postgres.

1.  Index key column

        CREATE INDEX index1 ON table1 (col1, col2, col3)

2.  Index on non key column

        CREATE INDEX index2 ON table1 (col1) INCLUDE (col2, col3)

3.  index1 is better suited for this kind of query:

        SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1 = x AND col2 = y AND col3 = z

4.  Whereas index2 is better suited for this kind of query:

        SELECT col2, col3 FROM table1 WHERE col1 = x;
